# Brainflix

Project no. 3 of the BrainStation 2020 Full-Time Online Web Development curriculum.

## Sprint I

You have been approached by an entrepreneur to build out a prototype for a new video streaming platform called BrainFlix. The entrepreneur has meetings lined up for funding with several VCs and needs the prototype built within the next three weeks. BrainFlix’s Creative Director has provided you with a package and mockup of how they envision the final product. There is also a separate team that is currently working on a back-end API needed to integrate with the front-end, but for the time being the static components need to be put together.

It will be your job to create a functioning and responsive app prototype from the project designs provided.

## Sprint II

For this sprint, you have been provided some updated mock ups for an additional screen that will be part of the site, as well as some new features to be added. Another team is developing some back-end functionality for the new features that you will need to use for the following sprint, so for now you will implement these features in the browser using Javascript until the back-end is ready.

Your goal will be to make the site interactive using JavaScript, and to add a second page to the site according to the mockups and design specs.

## Sprint III

Great work! So far everything is going as planned, however, the decision has been made to build out an actual API for the prototype and move away from using the mock API. The team at BrainFlix is confident in your ability to build out this new API, and have tasked you to develop it for this final sprint.

Using the mock API as your guide, build out your own API service that will manage the video data, and update the client application to use your API service.
